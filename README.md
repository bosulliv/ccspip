# Classic Computer Science Problems, in Python[This](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python)is an interesting and short(ish) book describing, exploring and solving sometypical computer science problems in Python.In the style of 'Learn Python the Hard Way', I quite like glancing at theat the listings and attempting to complete them myself. When I need to learnsomething new, or the code is too concise, I add comments to explain how itworks.
