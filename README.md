# Classic Computer Science Problems, in Python[This](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python)is an excellent and short(ish) book describing, exploring and solving someclassic computer science problems in Python.In the style of 'Learn Python the Hard Way', I quite like typing in thelistings, or attempting to complete it at a glance. I also add quite a lot ofcomments to sections that are not clear to me; Either because it is veryconscise, or more often because the technique is new to me.
